<h1>Application Overview</h1>
<p class="Section">ezMP3 will be a program where users can quickly convert and download a YouTube link
    in .mp3 format. It is useful for archiving and backing up vulnerable sounds posted to video 
    sharing sites.
</p>

<h1>Technology Overview</h1>
<p class="Section">This program is written in Python 3. A few libraries that ezMP3 utilizes are 
    PyTube and MoviePy. The goal for this program is durability. Since website APIs periodically change,
    ezMP3 will be written with resilience in mind. Due to a grey-area in legality, this program is not
    hosted online in any public capacity. It will function as a standalone Python script that can be run
    on any operating system so long as Python 3 and the required libraries are installed. Any demo of ezMP3 presented by the creator
    will only be done so using videos he retains 100% exclusive copyright on.
</p>
